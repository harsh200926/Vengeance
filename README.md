# Heart's Journal

A romantic diary webpage created to display personal journal entries in a beautiful, interactive format.

## Overview

This webpage beautifully presents diary entries with:

- An animated entrance page with a heartbeat animation
- Journal entries organized by date
- A quotes section featuring memorable lines from the diary
- A personal love letter
- Search and filter functionality to find specific entries

## How to View the Webpage

1. Ensure all files are in the same directory:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `scripts.js`
   - `emoji-fix.html` (utility for fixing any emoji display issues)
   - The `DiaryEntries` folder containing all diary entry files

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the webpage.

3. Press the "Open My Heart" button on the landing page to enter the main content.

4. Navigate between sections using the menu at the top of the page:
   - Journal: Browse all diary entries
   - Love Notes: Read meaningful quotes from the diary
   - My Letter: View a special letter

## Fixing Emoji Display Issues

If you notice any emoji display problems (like "Ã°Å¸'â€“" instead of "ðŸ’–"), you can:

1. Open `emoji-fix.html` in your browser
2. Select a diary entry file from the dropdown
3. Click "Fix Emojis" to correct the encoding
4. Use "Save to File" to download the corrected file
5. Replace the original file in the DiaryEntries folder with the fixed version

The main webpage (`index.html`) already has emoji fixing built in, but this separate tool can help fix the original files if needed.
