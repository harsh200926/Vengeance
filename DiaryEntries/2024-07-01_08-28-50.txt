hi 
I've completed my physical challenges and now I'm going to complete the rest academic challenges
I completed all my DPP's of physics, 4 are left of maths and revision in chemistry.

today, when I was returning home from the ground I saw a girl in front of the gate, At first I thought that she was she, but after I returned home I saw that her door wasn't locked up, but she was really looking like her but you know, I guessed it that she wasn't that. and then I accomplish all challenges that I've took. and since evening she isn't at home, I don't know where she is??, I trust her her character isn't that bad she must be at relatives. but you know I'm missing her so much it's been 5 days since the last time I saw her! 
still waiting, I'm working hard for, you just come back 🫴🤌💐

this video can describe what I feel for you.
we will be together, just wait for me nothing is impossible in this world until you make up your mind good night 💐
