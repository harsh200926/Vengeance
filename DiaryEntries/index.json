You know, when she comes, the happiness that I get is something that I can't describe in words. I just want that she stay with me always and stay happy and I don't need anything else, I have seen her after so many days, now I feel I should see her everyday and keep looking at her I had skipped my class to see her but she did not come at that time.\nSo from today I have started working on myself slowly and yes, I have also completed the challenge that I had taken for 10 days and I have now extended it till 10th July and now I know that I will do it because God is with me. I just want to become a good and kind person from my old version, whom everyone likes because I know how loneliness feels.\nLet's leave all this aside, now I feel that I cannot love anyone else except her because I no longer have that much courage or desire.And now I can't even like anyone else again because I like her so much that I am ready to do anything for her just to get her somehow. Now if not her then no one else!\nI LOVE YOU UNTIL MY LAST BREATH 💖🫶\n\nbut I don't know her name till now!\ntoday's pic after exercise."

Then maybe she'll be with me.\nSo today I could not see her coming because she must have come at 6 o'clock, so it doesn't matter, till then I have to work on myself and have to work so much that she sees me as she is falling in love with me💐🫶💌\nSo nothing happened today, but I don't know why I am feeling sad. Maybe because today when she was leaving, she did not even look at me and neither did I see her coming today.

I have wasted this whole month because of my negligence, from this I learnt that one does not even know when a small spark turns into a fire, initially you will think what can I do with this small thing, what is happening in doing it once but you do not know that this becomes the root of a bad habit.. \n\nlet's take my own example that how I ruined this whole month all by one mistake: - So at the end of July I had a lot of determination, concentration, and I was completely confident that I would not get distracted at all, meaning I was busy motivating others, but I did not do much. I had become overconfident, so the biggest mistake I made was that when Alakh sir was taking lectures he said that you should start watching the lectures a little late and then watch it at 1.5x so this is what created the biggest problem my penalty is over, because of that I started taking lessons late and then slowly started skipping them, because of that this problem started at the end of my July and then from the beginning of August this problem started that I started watching reels before the lecture and many other shits! Then my mind used to get filled with cheap dopamines and then I did not feel like studying and then slowly by mid of August I got into the habit of procrastination, I was again not able to cross the plan I had made myself because I had promised that I will complete it with full hard work and still I have not been able to regain that concentration but it does not matter, I will now do that which I have not done till date, just wait and watch. \n\n1. Although, if I tell you the whole thing, it all started exactly from 2nd August, when I broke my promise, now I could not keep that promise, that's why this whole month got wasted because of him... \n- **Negligence** can lead to wasted time and the development of bad habits. \n- Overconfidence and small actions can create bigger issues, emphasizing the importance of staying vigilant and **disciplined** in one's commitments. \n- Breaking a promise or routine can result in a **downward spiral** of procrastination and a loss of focus. \n- Despite setbacks, a renewed determination to overcome past mistakes and achieve set goals is crucial for **personal growth**. \n\n\"Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.\" - Lao Tzu"
