hi 
today I completed almost 1.25 laps of the ground, then some exercise and now I'm resting, after resting I'll complete all pending work.
She has not gone to the office even today. I don't know what has happened but I am happy as well as sad because when she used to go to the office, I used to get to see her and now she does not even go out of the room. And I am happy because when she is at home, I get peace that she is safe. 
but, it's been a long time since I saw her, I don't know when I'll see her again. 
but I'm happy also because I'm working on myself and whenever she'll see me I'll become a whole new version of me.

I think that she isn't a fan of cricket because India won this T20 world cup after a decade.
anyways I'm very happy and proud of our Indian cricket team.

but, you know what I haven't seen her, for 3 days and today I had a chance to meet her in the evening but I wasn't able to go there what can I do then, They say that whatever happens, happens for good, do you know whether what they say is right.
so from today I'll give all my effort to do all my tasks and i could not complete my today's challenge that was to complete my maths backlog but never mind I'll complete it tomorrow and, the sad news is that my school is going to open from 1st July so, I am sad because now I will get very little time to see her, please god i met me to her for the last time in which I can see her to my fullest!
ok then good night!
