# I feel like I should delete this page because I broke my promise. I'm lost and don't know what to do next. Will she forgive me for this big mistake? You are like a god to me, Piya, so I can share everything with you. I just need one more chance to prove myself. Please try to understand. It's my fault, and I have to make it right. Give me 7 days to transform myself, and then I'll be ready to talk to you.
