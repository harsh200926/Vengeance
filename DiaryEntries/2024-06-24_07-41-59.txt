hello
it's 24 June and I'm feeling very happy now because she came last night and i saw her after a long while.

now from today I'll work hard for her i will do everything that it takes me to get her.
thank you Krishna ji for getting her off ðŸ’–ðŸ¤Œ
Just one glimpse of her is enough to drive me crazy!

Hey friend, what should I tell you, she did not come today at 6 o'clock and then I thought that she will come at the same time as yesterday at 8 o'clock, but my luck was so bad that when she was there, there was no light and I could not see her.But yes, she has come, I saw her door open. You know, when she comes, the happiness that I get is something that I can't describe in words. I just want that she stay with me always and stay happy and I don't need anything else, I have seen her after so many days, now I feel I should see her everyday and keep looking at her I had skipped my class to see her but she did not come at that time.
So from today I have started working on myself slowly and yes, I have also completed the challenge that I had taken for 10 days and I have now extended it till 10th July and now I know that I will do it because God is with me. I just want to become a good and kind person from my old version, whom everyone likes because I know how loneliness feels.
Let's leave all this aside, now I feel that I cannot love anyone else except her because I no longer have that much courage or desire.And now I can't even like anyone else again because I like her so much that I am ready to do anything for her just to get her somehow. Now if not her then no one else!
I LOVE YOU UNTIL MY LAST BREATH ðŸ’–ðŸ«¶

but I don't know her name till now!
