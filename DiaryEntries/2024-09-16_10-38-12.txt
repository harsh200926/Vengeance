True Determination 
I want to say that today is 28th August and this is the end of this month so. 

1. I have wasted this whole month because of my negligence, from this I learnt that one does not even know when a small spark turns into a fire, initially you will think what can I do with this small thing, what is happening in doing it once but you do not know that this becomes the root of a bad habit.. 

let's take my own example that how I ruined this whole month all by one mistake: - So at the end of July I had a lot of determination, concentration, and I was completely confident that I would not get distracted at all, meaning I was busy motivating others, but I did not do much. I had become overconfident, so the biggest mistake I made was that when Alakh sir was taking lectures he said that you should start watching the lectures a little late and then watch it at 1.5x so this is what created the biggest problem my penalty is over, because of that I started taking lessons late and then slowly started skipping them, because of that this problem started at the end of my July and then from the beginning of August this problem started that I started watching reels before the lecture and many other shits! Then my mind used to get filled with cheap dopamines and then I did not feel like studying and then slowly by mid of August I got into the habit of procrastination, I was again not able to cross the plan I had made myself because I had promised that I will complete it with full hard work and still I have not been able to regain that concentration but it does not matter, I will now do that which I have not done till date, just wait and watch. 

1. Although, if I tell you the whole thing, it all started exactly from 2nd August, when I broke my promise, now I could not keep that promise, that's why this whole month got wasted because of him... 
- **Negligence** can lead to wasted time and the development of bad habits. 
- Overconfidence and small actions can create bigger issues, emphasizing the importance of staying vigilant and **disciplined** in one's commitments. 
- Breaking a promise or routine can result in a **downward spiral** of procrastination and a loss of focus. 
- Despite setbacks, a renewed determination to overcome past mistakes and achieve set goals is crucial for **personal growth**.
