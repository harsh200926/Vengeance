hi, 
I've completed my physical challenges, today was a rest day so I went back home sooner.
and I'm going to school soon, I miss her too much everywhere, i think about her all the day but I don't know how to see her, it's been a week....🙂
but still I'll always love you 💞💗,  no matter what!
you are the only one whom I mentioned in all of my prayers 💌✨


so today also i wasn't able to complete my challenges, and I've cut my hair 💐
today has been a very bad day.
you know it's been raining when I was returning home and I was remembering you the whole  journey...💌💐🫶
I'll fight for you, no matter who is standing against me! until my last breath 💌, it's been too long time since I saw you, i don't know what will happen next but I will always love you💐🫶🙂🤌
